Diversity and Inclusivity is a key part of our project. We firmly believe that by actively listening to everyone's opinions, we are able to expand our horizons and consider unique perspectives and gather innovation and strength from these differences. 



As contributors of this project, we strive to:

* Create an environment that is **open to collaboration and welcomes healthy discussions of ideas**
* **Acknowledge and appreciate** the time and effort each team member puts into making this project a success
* **Show empathy** for unexpected circumstances among group members
* **Trust** that all members have the best interests of the project at heart
* Accepting constructive criticism gracefully, and **work diligently** to solve issues with other group members if necessary



Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include (but are not limited to):

* Disrespect, harassment or ill-will of any kind against any group member
* Violent threats or language use
* Continued disruption of discussions, online or in-person
* Unwelcome physical contact without consent or after a request to stop
* Micro-aggressions or stereotyping based on a person's race, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, age, religions or beliefs
* Excessive swearing or rough language, especially if directed to another group member



Violation of any of the above will result in consequences dependant on the severity of the breach. This may include issuing a verbal warning to the offender or expulsion from the group and a written report of the incident to responsible bodies of authority.



If any suspicions of a breach in the code of conduct arise, group members are encouraged to report the incident to a trusted person of authority (e.g. TA's or any course instructor). UBC also offers a 24/7 available system of support, which can be found at this link:https://students.ubc.ca/health/crisis-support-services/.
